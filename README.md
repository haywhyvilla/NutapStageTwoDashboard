# Responsive Dashboard Design
This repository contains the code for my responsive dashboard design project, which was built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

# Code Base and Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

src: Contains the source code for the application, images and fonts
public: Contains the public assets for the application
The source code is written in React with the help of the Vite build tool, and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project has a modular structure with separate files for each component of the dashboard.

# Difficulty Encountered
During the development of this project, I faced a few challenges related to responsive design. One of the main difficulties was making sure that the dashboard looked good and functioned properly on different screen sizes. I addressed this by using responsive design techniques such as media queries and flexbox layouts.
Overall, I found this project to be a great opportunity to learn about building responsive dashboards using React and Tailwind CSS.
